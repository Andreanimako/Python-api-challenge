This assignment looked at weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and cloudiness in 1500 randomly selected cities identified by their latitude and longitude.
The correlation between these parameters of weather and latitude are determined by plotting scatter plots and regression line plots.
An "Ideal" weather condition wass determined as temperature ranging between 21 and 27 degrees celsius, wind speed of less than 4.5 m/s and no cloudiness. This served as the basis to determine the best vacation cities, and hotels were identified in these ideal vacation cities and plotted on a map.
